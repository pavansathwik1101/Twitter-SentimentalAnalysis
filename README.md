# Twitter-SentimentalAnalysis
Here we are using exisiting dataset from kaggle to train the model for classifying tweets into positive negative neutral.
we are using 3 different algorithms to train the model
     - Bernoulli Naive Bayes
     - Support Vector Machine
     - Logistic Regression
After training the model we are comparing the accuracy of these algos on some parameter like
     - Accuracy Score
     - Confusion Matrix with Plot
     - ROC-AUC Curve
